# Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a website that people can find out more about Stoicism. The website aims to be an online resource where users can access articles, books, podcasts and sign up for a newsletter.
The idea to build a website about stoicism came from seeing a book called The Daily Stoic on my kitchen table.
