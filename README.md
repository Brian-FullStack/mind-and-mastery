# Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a website that people can find out more about Stoicism. The website aims to be an online resource where users can access articles, books, podcasts and sign up for a newsletter.
The idea to build a website about stoicism came from seeing a book called The Daily Stoic on my kitchen table.

 # Target Audience
 My target audience for this website is people between the ages of 20 and 45. Men and Women who want a point of reference for all things stoic and philosophy related. I wanted to keep the website predictiable and easy to navigate but also add a contempory  feel throughout. The use of high quality images and layouts acieve this.
 # User Stories
## As a user I want to join a community interested in stoicisim
The very first hero image that the user sees when the site loads calls for users to sign up using the form on the my mastery page.
This Call to Action can be found within the aside on each article page.

## As a user I want to read articles about some of the topics I am interested in
Using the navigation link "Articles" or scrolling down will bring the user to some published articles on the site. Users will get a short snippet of the article and the option to read more which will bring them to a seperate page containing the full article.

## As a user I want to see some feedback from other users who have signed up to Mind & Mastery
There is a small card within the articles sections which has a review from a current subscriber of Mind & Mastery. This is to inform prospective subscribers of how much current and past like their choice of signing up.

## As a user I would like to recieve promotional emails or newsletters from Mind & Mastery
There is a small form where users can add their email to subscribe to newsletters

## As a user I would like the site to be responsive.
I have added media queries to adjust to mobile breakpoints and have used rem and percentages in any elements which needed to be flexiable in their sizing

 # Design
 ## Colour Pallet
 The Color Pallet inspiration for Mind & Mastery came from towels hanging on the back of my bathroom door.

 I used [Colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) to make a color pallet out of the image.

 ## Typography
 I used a serif font, Cinzel for the logo and headings throughtout the site, that I found from Google Fonts because I thought that it felt elegant and easy to read.

 I used a neutral sans-serif font Heebo for the main copy throughout the site.

 ## Images 
 All of the images for this site came from unsplash. I tried to find images which evoked a stoic feeling and complemented the color pallet.

 ## Wireframes
 I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to build out my wireframes, I found it easy and intuitive to use and felt like it made sense to get comfortable working with the industry standard for this project
