                    <strong class="sub-heading">What is Goal Setting?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <em>“If you don’t have a consistent goal in life, you can’t live it in a consistent way.” — Marcus
                        Aurelius</em>
                    <br>
                    Epictetus said that goal setting was simple:

                    “First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.”

                    Let’s look at Marcus Aurelius as an example.

                    At an early age, Marcus, who studied the teachings of Epictetus, was adopted by the emperor Hadrian
                    and was groomed to be the emperor of Rome. An utterly anomalous event in human history would follow:
                    Marcus Aurelius did not go the way of all kings and instead was made a better person by having
                    enormous power thrust upon him. From his personal journal, known today as Meditations, we know it
                    was a decision. As Epictetus instructed, he first said to himself what he would be.

                    Marcus saw the “malice, cunning and hypocrisy that power produces,” as well as the “peculiar
                    ruthlessness often shown by people from ‘good families,’” and then he set his goal: he would be an
                    exception to that rule. “Take care not be Caesarified, or dyed in purple,” he wrote, “it happens. So
                    keep yourself simple, good, pure, serious, unpretentious, a friend of justice, god-fearing, kind,
                    full of affection, strong for your proper work. Strive hard to remain the same man that philosophy
                    wished to make you.”

                    Seneca said, “If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.” Marcus
                    Aurelius set his destination, his goal for the person he wished to be. And then he worked
                    consciously and deliberately, as we see in Meditations, to accomplish that goal, to do what he had
                    to do to be what he said he would be.

                    So to the Stoics, goals are a kind of polestar. They are the port of call. They are not so much what
                    push us, but what pulls us. They are that first part in Epictetus’ simple formula for a good life.
                    Setting a goal is saying, this is what I will be. Which leads us right into the second part. Once
                    you set your goal, once you say what you will be, goal setting becomes about figuring out what you
                    have to do.

                    <strong class="sub-heading">The Importance of Goal Setting</strong>
                    <br>
                    <em>“Let all your efforts be directed to something, let it keep that end in view. It’s not activity
                        that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that drive them mad.” — Seneca</em>
                    <br>
                    Goals Give You Clarity and Focus

                    Law 29 of The 48 Laws of Power is: Plan All The Way To The End. Robert Greene writes, “By planning
                    to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide
                    fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.” The second habit in The 7 Habits of
                    Highly Effective People is: begin with an end in mind.

                    Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it—no Stoic would tolerate that
                    assumption—but not having an end in mind is a guarantee you won’t. To the Stoics, oiêsis (false
                    conceptions) are responsible not just for disturbances in the soul but for chaotic and dysfunctional
                    lives and operations. When your efforts are not directed at a cause or a purpose, how will you know
                    what to do day in and day out? How will you know what to say no to and what to say yes to? How will
                    you know when you’ve had enough, when you’ve reached your goal, when you’ve gotten off track, if
                    you’ve never defined what those things are?

                    The answer is that you cannot. And so you are driven into failure—or worse, into madness by the
                    oblivion of directionlessness.

                    [2] Goals Help You Assess The Good and Bad

                    People have strong opinions about what is good and bad, positive or negative in life. Yet if you ask
                    most of them what they’re working towards, what their grand strategy for life actually is, most
                    can’t answer.

                    This is a contradiction. If you don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish or what’s important to
                    you—today or in life as a whole—you have no idea whether an event is truly good or bad.Without a
                    ruler, Seneca said, you can’t make crooked straight.

                    Without clear goals, without a point or purpose to aim for, all your thoughts on good news and bad
                    news, advantages and disadvantages are just pointless speculation.

                    You have to know what you’re trying to do today—and every day. You have to know what port you’re
                    aiming for. Otherwise, you’re just being blown around. You’re just reacting. And you’ll never end up
                    where you want to be.

                    [3] Goals Help You Beat Procrastination

                    Procrastination feeds on our uncertainty and chaos. The chaos that ensues from not having a plan.
                    Not because plans are perfect, but because people without plans—like a line of infantrymen without a
                    strong leader—are much more likely to get overwhelmed into inaction.

                    The Super Bowl–winning coach Bill Walsh used to avoid this risk by scripting the beginning of his
                    games. “If you want to sleep at night before the game,” he said in a lecture on game planning, “have
                    your first 25 plays established in your own mind the night before that. You can walk into the
                    stadium and you can start the game without that stress factor.” You’ll also be able to ignore a
                    couple of early points or a surprise from your opponent. It’s irrelevant to you—you already have
                    your marching orders.

                    Some of the world’s greatest minds—philosophers, artists, writers, painters, scientists, composers,
                    businessmen—have similarly boxed out the chaos of life by setting goals.

                    Procrastination loves confusion and complexity. It loves questions like, What was I going to do?
                    What do I wear? What time should I wake up? What should I eat? What should I do first? What should I
                    do after that? What sort of work should I do? Should I scramble to address this problem or should I
                    rush to put out that fire?

                    That’s what Seneca would call a life without design. And that’s what the Stoics would call torture.
                    When you haven’t set any goals, when you’re just winging it, when you are deciding on the fly what
                    you’re going to do or not—that decision fatigue evaporates motivation. On the flip side, goals
                    eliminate all that confusion and complexity and decision fatigue. We know what we need to do.
                    Procrastination is boxed out—by the order and clarity you built, the goals you set.

                    <strong class="sub-heading">How To Set Goals Like A Stoic</strong>
                    <br>
                    <em>“There is never a need to get worked up about things you can’t control.” — Marcus Aurelius</em>
                    <br>
                    The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change
                    and what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. The slave turned philosophy
                    teacher Epictetus described it as our “chief task in life.” It was, he said, simply “to identify and
                    separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and
                    which have to do with the choices I actually control.” Or, in his language, what is up to us and
                    what is not up to us (ta eph’hemin, ta ouk eph’hemin).

                    So, the Stoics would say, the number one rule in goal setting is to set goals that are up to you,
                    that are in your control.
                    Marcus Aurelius wasn’t measuring his accomplishments as emperor against the great conquerors of the
                    past—although certainly, he intended to win the wars he was forced to fight. Instead, his aim was
                    higher. He wanted to be good. To be decent. To be in command of himself. To live up to being “the
                    man that philosophy tried to make him.”

                    Winning is like being rich. It’s nice, but it’s not something in your control, day to day. What is
                    in your control is showing up, giving maximum effort, following your training, sticking to your
                    principles, pursuing your calling. If that translates to on the field success, great—in fact, it
                    almost always does. If that translates into career recognition, awesome—and again, it usually does.

                    <strong class="sub-heading">Don’t Set Too Many Goals</strong>
                    <br>
                    <em>“Ask yourself at every moment, Is this necessary?” — Marcus Aurelius</em>
                    <br>
                    Just like ours, the ancient world was filled with people who had ambitious goals and trouble
                    prioritizing them. Seneca said it’s one of the hardest balances to strike in life.

                    We don’t want to be the person who can never sit still. “For love of bustle is not industry, it is
                    only the restlessness of a hunted mind.” But we also don’t want to be the person always sitting
                    still. “True repose does not consist in condemning all motion as merely vexation,” he wrote, “that
                    kind of repose is slackness and inertia.”

                    The work of the philosopher, Seneca said, is finding the perfect balance of those two tendencies.
                    It’s about working and relaxing, not working and work avoidance.

                    <strong class="sub-heading">Make Sure They Are Your Goals</strong>
                    <br>
                    <em>“Stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions. But make sure you guard against the other
                        kind of confusion. People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought
                        and impulse toward are wasting their time—even when hard at work.” — Marcus Aurelius</em>
                    <br>
                    It can be deceiving to hear the Stoics talk about an indifference to external recognition or
                    rewards.

                    Marcus says that fame is meaningless. Seneca talks about how success or wealth is out of our control
                    and therefore not to be prized. Don’t want what other people want, they say, don’t get sucked into
                    meaningless competition.

                    So does this mean that the Stoic doesn’t try? That the Stoic is resigned to whatever happens to them
                    in life, caring about nothing, uninterested in improving or growing?

                    No, of course not. The Stoic is still incredibly ambitious—only they focus on an internal scorecard
                    versus an external one.
                    When you try to beat other people, you set yourself up to fail. But going against yourself—trying to
                    improve yourself—that’s a competition you have control over. It’s one you can win.
