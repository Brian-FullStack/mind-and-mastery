                    <em>“Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens
                        happen
                        the
                        way it happens: then you will be happy.” – Epictetus</em>
                    <br>
                    As mentioned before, hardship allows you to show your true character. So, embrace hardship. Amor
                    Fati.
                    Love your fate. Embrace every single moment, even moments of hell.

                    The chance of us existing is small, but here we are. The chances of that particular sperm
                    fertilizing
                    that particular egg were small. But here you are. You have already beaten seemingly insurmountable
                    odds.
                    Your existence is rare and beautiful. So, even our suffering is rare and beautiful.

                    Accepting your fate does not mean you’re necessarily okay with bad things happening to you. It means
                    you
                    are accepting that struggling is a part of existing. We can use this to persevere because this gives
                    us
                    the courage to act. Loving and appreciating every minute shows us that we are not helpless. We are
                    just
                    experiencing what it means to exist.

                    <strong class="sub-heading">Don’t complain</strong>
                    <br>
                    <em>“Everything that happens is either endurable or not. If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop
                        complaining. If it’s unendurable… then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as
                        well.
                        Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your
                        interest
                        to do so. In your interest, or in your nature.” — Marcus Aurelius</em>
                    <br>
                    Either you persevere or you don’t. Regardless, complaining does not necessarily tip the odds in your
                    favor. Yes, feel emotions. Yes, confide in people. But do not tell yourself you will fail. Do not
                    tell
                    anyone else you will fail. Don’t tell anyone that this specific struggle will be the end of you.

                    Complaining, in fact, makes it harder to endure. Marcus argues that you can endure anything by
                    thinking
                    it’s endurable. If you allow yourself to complain, you’re defeating yourself.

                    You may be able to get through something by complaining. But, that will not leave your good nature
                    intact. To exercise virtue in the face of adversity, we must have control over our own minds.

                        a bad man.’ What difference is it to you who the giver assigns to take it back?” —
                        Epictetus</em>
                    <br>
                    Way harsh, but there’s still a lesson here. Epictetus urges us to not take things personally. Things
                    are
                    not taken from you, but returned. After all, the entire universe existed before us and will exist
                    after
                    us.

                    Likewise, we existed before our current struggle and will exist after it.

                    In the final episode of Bojack Horseman, Bojack says, “Life’s a bitch and then you die, right?”
                    Diane
                    responds, “Sometimes. Sometimes life’s a bitch and then you keep living.” We live despite and in
                    spite
                    of how much life sucks. Life won’t always be suffering, but life is contingent on suffering. When we
                    lose an opportunity, a loved one, or when life is just bad, the best thing to do is live virtuously
                    no
                    matter what.

                    This difficulty will end. You will end. We can only control our response to that.

                    <br>
                    Seneca is reminding us that we have some control over our lives. By putting off action, we are
                    allowing
                    our suffering to have full control.

                    By working towards ending our suffering, we are regaining control. Persevering is active. We don’t
                    persevere by shutting down until it’s over.

                    We persevere by responding rationally to our hardships. We persevere by determining the most
                    virtuous
                    course of action. Persevere immediately.

                        Epictetus</em>
                    <br>
                    When we are struggling, we may want to give up on ourselves. We may settle. We may get used to
                    things
                    being okay and give up on striving for a good life. This is unacceptable.

                    Like we said, you can either persevere or stop. Either way, we are dying at some point. As Epictetus
                    says, we can die ordinary if we choose to not persevere. Everything ends at some point, but there is
                    power in the choice to persevere. A hardship can either end because we act to make it end or we die.
                    We
                    have some control over when our suffering ends.

                    We must demand that we get through this hardship. Clean your room a little. Ask for better
                    treatment.
                    Advocate for yourself and take care of yourself. We cannot get used to suffering. We can accept the
                    existence of suffering, but we still have to fight against it. Do not become complacent.

                    <br>
                    <em>“We suffer not from the events in our lives, but from our judgment about them.” — Epictetus</em>
                    <br>
                    Perhaps our suffering is mostly self-inflicted. When difficulties arise, we sometimes take it
                    personally. It’s important to take accountability for actions that cause suffering, but you can do
                    that
                    without suffering.

                    Instead of saying, “I lost my job because I’m lazy and stupid,” you can say, “I lost my job because
                    I
                    did not meet the requirements for it.” The difference between those two sentences is that one is
                    reporting a judgment and the other is reporting a fact. We suffer less when we rationally map why
                    things
                    happen.

                    Calling ourselves stupid for letting something happen does not solve the problem and makes us feel
                    worse. Shit usually happens purely because shit happens. Taking it personally makes it harder to
                    actively solve the problem. Recognizing that it is not 100% our fault can give us the courage to
                    act.

                        use. On
                        the occasion of an accidental event, don’t just react in a haphazard fashion: remember to turn
                        inward
                        and ask what resources you have for dealing with it. Dig deeply. You possess strengths you might
                        not
                        realize you have. Find the right one. Use it.” – Epictetus</em>
                    <br>
                    We enter fight or flight mode when it gets tough. However, the good thing about being humans is that
                    we
                    have the ability to be rational.

                    Don’t go into survival mode. Take a breath and remember you have the opportunity to outwardly show
                    your
                    virtue. Not everything needs a reaction. Moreover, not everything needs an immediate reaction.

                    While persevering is active, you can still take time to decide what to do. You do not need to react
                    immediately unless it’s life or death. Let it stew. </p>
